# Module `i18n`.

This module contains a powerful internationalization framework for Fragment.js.

The user should be able to open in the application an specific route and handle the languages keys
and its translations. When the user make any change it will update the translations (JSON files) in
the backend and will create the needed types for typescript to develop. The user will be able to see
the changes in the application. This will be guarded by user authentication.
